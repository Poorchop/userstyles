### HexChat Docs Dark

Dark theme for the [HexChat client documentation](http://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

I plan on expanding this in the future to include more documentation on Read the Docs.

This style is heavily influenced by [GitHub Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark),
from which it borrows large chunks of CSS. The code blocks also follow the Monokai color scheme.
